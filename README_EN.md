# 1. Project : Flight Simulation

## 1.1. Context

This program simulate an intern captor airplane environment. Four types of sensors are linked through a scheduler to a server:
- Temperature sensor
- Humidity sensor
- Pressure sensor
- Light sensor


## 1.2. Scenario

The scheduler periodically retrieves the data generated by the sensors then sends them to the server. It will log in files and/or display the data in the console.

The sensors generate data according to reality:
- 23°C average temperature with a 3°C dispersion 
- 20% average humidity with an 8% dispersion
- 79289 Pascal average pressure with 3447 Pascal dispersion
- Light intensity is represented as a boolean

## 1.3. How to use the program

The executable file will be in the Simulation/ repertory. (The logs files need to be in the Simulation/logs/ repertory if the program was launched from Simulation/)

The program runs util the userenter "q" in the terminal. (There is a little latency as all threads have to synchronize.)

/!\ Entry in the terminal can be ignored if a cout is performed before the user has pressed ENTER. Thus he will have to type "q"+ENTER again.

## 1.4. Credits

This plane sensor environment simulation implementation was made for the 2022 Automn semester AP4A course. <br>
